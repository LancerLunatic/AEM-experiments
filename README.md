path to shared library for phone numbers script README
Sure, here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use symbolic links in AEM to access a shared library for pulling in customer phone numbers from a 3rd
party affiliate:

In this example, we create a symbolic link to a shared library located at /path/to/shared/library in the /apps/myproject/libraries/shared-library directory of our
AEM instance. We then use this symbolic link to import the
PhoneNumberService and Customer classes from a third-party affiliate and to retrieve customer phone numbers using the SharedLibrary class.

Note that this is just an example, and the specific implementation details will depend on the structure of your project and the requirements of your use case.
Additionally, it is important to ensure that you are using symbolic links in a secure manner and that you are not exposing sensitive information to malicious actors.
